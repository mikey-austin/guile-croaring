guile-croaring
--------------

guile-croaring aims to provide a Guile Scheme extension in order to make use of
the CRoaring [1] compressed bitmap/bitset library from Scheme.

This project provides a shared library artifact suitable for dynamically loading
into a guile interpreter. The produced shared library bundles the amalgamated
CRoaring source code, so no separate installation of CRoaring is necessary. There
does not seem to be any standard widely distributed packages of CRoaring (eg in
the fedora/centos repositories, etc.) thus the actual guile extension approach. Had
there been a "suitably available" CRoaring OS package distribution a guile dynamic
FFI approach would have been preferred to avoid all of the C glue.

This project uses the autotools build system; specifically the trinity of automake,
libtool and autoconf. As there are no distributed tarballs yet, a recent version
of the aforementioned autotools programs must be installed in order to build. The
following is usually enough to get started:

  $ autoreconf -i
  ...
  $ ./configure
  $ make

See the included INSTALL file for more details. Further instructions on how to use
the resulting extension with guile will come.
